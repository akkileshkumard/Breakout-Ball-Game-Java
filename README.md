## Description

Breakout Ball is a classic arcade game implemented in Java using Swing. The objective of the game is to destroy all the bricks by bouncing a ball off a paddle. Players control the paddle horizontally to prevent the ball from falling off the bottom of the screen. Each brick destroyed earns points, and the game ends when all bricks are cleared or the ball falls below the paddle.

- **Brick Destruction**: Break bricks by bouncing the ball against them.
- **Score Tracking**: Earn points for each brick destroyed.
- **Game Over**: Lose a life when the ball falls below the paddle. Game ends when all lives are lost or all bricks are destroyed.
- **Restart**: Press Enter to restart the game after winning or losing.
- **Sound Effects**: Added sound effects for ball collisions with bricks and paddle.
- **Dynamic Ball Movement**: Ball speed increases over time with randomized direction changes.
- **Fullscreen Support**: Toggle fullscreen mode with the fullscreen icon for an immersive experience.
